**Why choosed React?**


Let’s take a walk down to the technology space before 2015 when web development was all about scripting and rendering. The time when languages like HTML, CSS ruled the frontend, and PHP ruled the backend.

Web development was so easy back then. All we needed to do was to put static HTML pages in some folders and render them using PHP. Although that’s not a unique and intuitive way to develop websites, you were still able to establish a two-way connection between client and server. All the credit goes to Server-Side Rendering (SSR). We’ve been building web applications this way for decades, but what we didn’t see coming is the revolution of websites after Javascript libraries like Reactjs.

React was primarily used to render views in web or mobile applications. It allowed us to create reusable components that are independent of each other. So when any critical feature of a web application broke, they were still better off with the remaining elements. Also, React brought this fantastic feature called Virtual DOM that enabled us to implement SSR without needing to update the whole view each time during an update.It has also provided us the sauce of SPA.

**Run a Cloned React Project**


The node_modules directory is not a part of a cloned repository and should be downloaded using the npm install command to download all the direct and transitive dependencies mentioned in the package.json file:

**make sure that you are in the root directory of the project, use" pwd" or "cd" for windows**


cd RepoName


npm install

It will take some time to download all the dependencies into a node_modules directory, and after the download completion, run the project:

npm run start

**Deployment**


The musicwiki web app is created by keeping easy accessibility of users in mind as it is a mobile focused app.it will hence provide a better experience to the users.Thereby i am attaching the link for my piece of work.
